    <b> THE WHY
      Your clicks generate lots of money for the Facebook’s and Google’s of the world and in turn they provide us with a services to connect and inform us. But you’re creating the data; shouldn’t you be able to monitize it too?
      Much like the unionization of labor in the US in the late 1800s, one person on their own does not have much power. However, when combined with many, the power of a strike or values of the data becomes significant. </b>
